# Nik's solution

I decided to start with the second requirement as when implemented that would have solved the first requirement.

I opted for using a one-dimensional array instead of a 2D array for tracking the game state as it felt it provided a simpler solution.

Things I would have considered if I had more time:

- better styling
- better validation of the form field
- more elegant fetching
